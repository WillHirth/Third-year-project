Researching Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing


Natural language processing is the field of research focused on computers using text or speech as input and providing some meaningful output (such as predicting the next word or summarising the text), often using machine learning. It has a rich history dating back to the 1950s with famous examples such as the Turing test, a test devised to test if a computer can think like a human, being commonly spoken of outside of computer science. With advances in the field such as GPT-3 computers can produce authentic sounding text, compare two passages, and calculate the similarity between them, or produce a written form of spoken text automatically. On the other hand, one area in which machine learning struggles is deriving the meaning behind a sentence but with the field ever changing and advances in sentiment analysis computers may be able to “understand” speech soon. This project aims to research these current techniques and produce a model able to, with high accuracy, take multiple pieces of text and classify them into two opposing groups, for example, positive and negative sentiments, or real and fake.
